## Background

The association of lifestyle factors and myopia has been long discussed.

Since my childhood, I was repeated advised by optometrists that:

* My prescription could keep increasing until adulthood

* Spend more time outdoors, it will save your vision

* **Stay away from those electronic garbage (from Mom)**

* Take regular breaks and avoid prolonged focused reading

With Statistics, can we find supporting evidence for the claims above?

```{r start, echo = 2, error = TRUE}
```

Finding the answer is not easy, and the realm of medical-related statistics is full of variables with random behaviour (weak correlation, confounding, ...)

## The Data

The dataset is from [ggeop/Myopia-Study](https://github.com/ggeop/Myopia-Study).

* A subset of the research from Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia

* Conducted in 1989-1990 and 2000-2001

* Consists of 618 observations and 17 variables

However, we are only interested in seven of the variables.

```{r data, echo = 4}
```

---

## Variable Definition

```{r data-def, echo = FALSE}
```

---

## A First Glance

```{r prelim, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```

* All numeric variables except for `age` are heavily right-skewed.

---

## Log-Transformation But ...

```{r minimum, highlight.output = c(2, 9)}
```

* A simple log-transformation is not feasible.

* A `log1p` transformation could be a good alternative.

---

## Seems to be Some Overshooting

```{r overfix, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```

* A `log1p` transformation seems to over-fix skewness of `sporthr` and `tvhr`.

---

## The Transformed Data

```{r data-trans, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```

* The transformed data is far better, despite much departure from normality.

---

## Bivariate Association with Myopia

```{r effect, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
```

* The bivariate correlations with myopia of the variables are relatively weak.

---

## More Diagnostics

.pull-left[
```{r eov}
```

* `sqrt` transformed variables have substantially larger variance.

* EOCV is compromised for better normality.
]

.pull-right[
```{r vif}
```

* The variance inflation factors are reasonably small.

* Concern of multicollinearity can be dismissed.
